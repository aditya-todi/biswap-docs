**Staff Game**   is a win-win game with a low entry cost. It requires fewer resources to play than the Main game. To participate in the game, a user needs to hire a Worker. Once the hiring period is over, a user will receive fixed rewards in BSW with **up to 270% ROI in just 10 days!**

### &#x20;<a href="#requirements-to-participate" id="requirements-to-participate"></a>

To begin playing, a user must complete the following steps:

### &#x20;<a href="#workers-price" id="workers-price"></a>

The cost to hire one Worker is fixed  —  **25 BSW**. Press **Hire **_****_ and get a Worker with random hiring time and ROI.

_Important: the amount of your investment, 25 BSW, will be returned to you at the end of the **hiring duration of your Worker** along with a gained BSW reward._

Enjoy earning vast rewards with up to **10 000%** APR via Gamified Staking! Your profit depends on the ROI and amount of days of your Worker.

### &#x20;<a href="#probability-of-getting-a-certain-number-of-days" id="probability-of-getting-a-certain-number-of-days"></a>

Workers will have a random number of days, from 10 to 30, for a hiring duration. Take a look at the chances of getting a specific hiring period in the corresponding [**article**](https://biswap.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/5767439218321-Staff-Game-is-Released-Enjoy-up-to-10-000-APR-) on Biswap Zendesk.

Return on Investment or ROI measures the profitability or efficiency of a particular trade or investment. When hiring a **Worker**, the user will obtain it with a random ROI (from 15% to 270%). Let’s review the probability percentages in the corresponding [**article**](https://biswap.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/5767439218321-Staff-Game-is-Released-Enjoy-up-to-10-000-APR-) on Biswap Zendesk.

### &#x20;<a href="#calculating-apr" id="calculating-apr"></a>

To calculate the APR is quite simple, divide ROI by the number of days and multiply the sum you got by 365 days.

_Use this simple formula to calculate your APR: **APR=(ROI/Days)\*365**_

### &#x20;<a href="#workers-limit-distribution" id="workers-limit-distribution"></a>

Each user can have a maximum of **two** active Workers. For example, a user has already hired **two** Workers. If one of them has run out of hiring period, the user can hire one additional Worker.

Workers' distribution is available **** two times per week:

⏰ Thursday at **12:00 AM UTC**

⏰ Thursday at **12:00 PM UTC**

### &#x20;<a href="#amount-per-block-needed-to-run-the-game" id="amount-per-block-needed-to-run-the-game"></a>

The game may not be played for 255 blocks from the **Hire** transaction. If the Worker is played after the 255th block, the given numbers (ROI and Days) will be replayed and changed according to the information in the pop-up shown to the user at the Worker’s purchase.

_The player can launch the game manually by calling the function ‘**selfclaim**’ of the contract. To do that, please get in touch with_ [_**Biswap Live Support.**_](https://biswap.org/)

### &#x20;<a href="#commission-for-an-early-withdrawal" id="commission-for-an-early-withdrawal"></a>

The commission for an early withdrawal is **5%**.

_For example, you hired a Worker for 10 days but then decided to withdraw after 8 days had passed. **In this case, you will pay a 5% fee from the Worker’s price and you won’t get a reward.**_

### &#x20;<a href="#rewards-accrual" id="rewards-accrual"></a>

There are a few essential aspects to consider when it comes to rewards accrual:

* Rewards are accrued for each block and are in the BSW token.
* Users can withdraw rewards without the commission after the hiring period of a Worker has run out.
* 10 BSW must be staked in the Holder Pool at the withdrawal time to receive rewards.

To obtain the rewards, press the **Claim** button.

_Workers can be purchased, and rewards redeemed only in the **BSW**  **token**._
