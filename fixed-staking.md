# Fixed Staking

Please remember that after you have staked with [**Fixed Staking on Biswap**](https://biswap.org/fixed\_staking), you can withdraw your tokens without a fee after a specific deadline. So if users withdraw before 30, 60 or 90 days run out, they need to pay a commission of **1.99%** from the deposit amount + the acquired rewards. Users can unstake without fee after the lock term has passed.
