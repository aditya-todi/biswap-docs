# Exchange

**Biswap Exchange** is an automated market maker (AMM) that allows a user to exchange two tokens on the Binance Smart Chain network. The liquidity provided to the exchange comes from Liquidity Providers ("LPs") who stake their tokens in Liquidity Pools. In exchange, a user gets LP tokens that can also be staked to earn BSW tokens in the "Farms".
